# N-Puzzle-Board-Game
 A puzzle game where the player must move the blank cell to the lower left cell of the board without breaking the sequence with the move commands.

At the start of the game game will ask the size of the board and create n x n game board with user input(n)

There are 7 commands available for the user after the first creation of the game board:

Note: All commands are case sensitive

R: Moves the blank cell to the right

L: Moves the blank cell to the left

U: Moves the blank cell to the up

D: Moves the blank cell to the down

I: Game makes the best move for the solution(not that intelligent)

S: Saves the current board state to target txt file(provided by user) as string.

W: Load a game board from existing txt file. Resets move counter

If the game reaches a solution after a move, it will print total number of moves made and terminates the program.

Since the code wasn't written for this purpose and I tried my best to make it playable, some functionalities that are not working on runtime and unreasonable codes can be found here and there.
